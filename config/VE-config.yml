Title: VisionEval
Date: 2019-03-26
Roots: # Require ve.root and ve.output at a minimum
    ve.root: c:/Users/jeremy.DESKTOP-OLMEAON/Documents/Git-Repos/VisionEval-JR
    ve.output: e:/VE-built/VE-1.02  # Required
    ve.cache: e:/VE-built/VE-Cache  # Optional
    # However ve.cache is "special" in that, if defined, anything stored there will require
    #    extra effort to remove between builds
    # additional roots may be defined (with unique names); here is an illustrative alias:
    ve.alt.root: c:/Users/jeremy.DESKTOP-OLMEAON/Documents/Git-Repos/VisionEval-JR # Optional
    # ve.install is implicitly available - relative to the running installer
Components:  # Entire section is optional
    # Default if this section is missing is to load all components from ve.root/build/VE-components.yml
    # The "roots" are processed in order; components from the first, then components from the second
    # Note that ve.root is special and will always be loaded first (with its Includes and Excludes applied)
    # Alternate roots will then be loaded in the order presented here
    # Components with the same name in later roots will replace components from earlier roots
    # If a new component appears in a later root it is just added to the existing set of components
    # Adding an "Install" list reduces the root configuration to just those components before replacement
    # Adding an "Exclude" list reduces the root configuration to everything EXCEPT those components before replacement
    ve.root:
        Config: "build/VE-components.yml" # relative to ve.root
        Exclude:
            - VE-State
    ve.alt.root:
      Config: "build/VE-components.yml" # relative to ve.alt.root 
      Include:
          - visioneval
