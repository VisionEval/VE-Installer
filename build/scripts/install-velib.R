# Script to install all required packages into ve.lib from within the local
# pkg-repository. This will install the packages necessary for the local runtime
# environment (source on Linux or MacOS; binaries on Windows, with an option to
# compile if Rtools is installed)

# We install these locally prior to the VE package build process (as a backstop
# to ensure that all required packages really are in the repository).

# NOTE: it is a bad idea to put the VE dependencies in your development
# environment since you will not easily be able to tell if you missed one

# uncomment the following line on Windows if you just want the pre-compiled
# binaries otherwise, if RTools is installed the newer sources packages will be
# compiled.  You should allow compilation to happen if there is discrepancy in
# behavior between a Windows installation and a source (e.g. Linux/Docker)
