R Version
	Major.Minor.Subversion
	(Use to select MRAN and BioConductor repository versions)
	(Run a batch file to find Rscript)
VE Root Location (may have more than one):
	Name, AbsolutePath
VE Build Location
	ve.root, AbsolutePath
VE Build Folders (relative name within Build location)
	ve.runtime (runtime environment, batch files, etc.)
	ve.depends (built dependencies, src + bin)
	ve.built (built packages for VE, src + bin)
	ve.pkgs (source repo for installer)
	ve.lib (installed binaries for installer/runtime)
Configuration Objects
	Dependency (repository class, name) (was type "CRAN" or "BioConductor")
	External (source path, name) (was type "install")
	VisionEval (source path, name) (was type "visioneval")
	Runtime (source path, name, runtime relative destination - name goes within) (was type "copy")

# Need to revisit build sequence and action partitioning
Steps:
	Dependency: Retrieve Dependencies (download to ve.depends/src, download to ve.depends/bin)
	External: Build external source packages (build to ve.depends/src)
	VisionEval: Build VE source packages (build to ve.built/src)
	Binary Build works off the three repositories built above
		Binary Build external packages (build ve.depends/src to ve.depends/bin; install to ve.lib)
		Binary Build VE binary packages (build ve.built/src to ve.built/bin; install to ve.lib)
		Assemble master packages (ve.depends + ve.built; src + bin; place in ve.pkgs)
	Copy Runtime objects into place
	Make Installer
