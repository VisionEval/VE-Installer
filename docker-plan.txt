Targets for docker images:

Construct a base image that is just the visioneval framework and modules
for running models.  Add commands to run RPAT or RSPM.  If nothing is
in the user's "model" volume, just run a test model (for RSPM, that will
be "Test1", but with an optional parameter).

We can get this to work by creating another models sub-directory ("UserModel")
which is the bind-mount volume point.  Empty by default.  If it is not empty,
then pre-empty running VERPAT or VERSPM and instead read the model and data
from the UserModel directory.

Even though BG has allowed for configurable input directory, the default
models don't do that.  The models need to be changed.

Add a Volume for the user to attach their model.
By default, run VERPAT.
For RSPM, run Test1 (with an option for Test2 as an extra parameter)

Create a separate image to run VEGUI, which exposes the test models.
Also allow the user to mount their model just as for the base, so it
becomes one of the choices.

Separate out the dependencies needed for VE itself from the dependencies
needed for VEGUI (to keep the runtimes small).
