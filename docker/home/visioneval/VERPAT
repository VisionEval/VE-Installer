# This script runs VERPAT, possibly on user-supplied data.

# If any argument, use the existing test data bundled alongside
# the model script.

# If UserData is not mounted, just run the bundled model and store
# its results in the container (as if use provided Test argument)

# If UserData is mounted and no argument, check for presence in
# "UserData" directory of necessary pieces (defs, inputs).
# If UserData is not suitable, fall back to running Test, but
# copy the Test data to a subdirectory of UserData (VERPAT-Test)
# (disambiguated with -1, -2, etc.) and run the model there.
