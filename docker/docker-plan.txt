Targets for docker images:

Work on a small, unobtrusive pull request for the visioneval framework that
allows the script to set a different directory for the model script.  Then
we can start the script working in the user's directory and still have
VE read it for the RunProcess statements. [Pull request issued; made
changes manually to base models, which are in the Installer docker
folder - the model scripts in the pulled version are ignored.  Does
require change to visioneval package.]

Create a separate image to run VEGUI, which exposes the test models.
Also allow the user to mount their model just as for the base, so it
becomes one of the choices.  The data/model separation can be pursued
into VEGUI.

Separate out the dependencies needed for VE itself from the dependencies
needed for VEGUI (to keep the runtimes small).  This is done (see
Install-Modules-Only dependency description - also skips copying
VEGUI into the image).
